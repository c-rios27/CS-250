How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories are specific features or things that a user wants on a program. Agile team members make software to meet the expectations of the user. To know the user's needs, we go through dicovery phase, where we ask the users what they want, how would they use it, etc. Then, we document and organize this information in order to extract the "user stories" from it.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I develop by coding smaller parts that, once joined, compose the program itself. Smaller parts are more manageable and easier to work with. Two Agile processes that I hope to incorporate in my future developments are the phases of Development and Testing. These two phases are fundamental to a project's successful deployment.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member communicates, plans, and is open to the idea's shared by other team members. Good team members communicate with peers, and know specific domain languages, as well as the project's main design priorities. Lastly, good team members use tracking software, so that they can track tickets and what is being worked on by who (so nobody steps on each other's toes).
